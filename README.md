Description

- Dinamically created levels (adding SKSpriteNode's (level obstruction) programmatically for each level in https://github.com/mishadovhiy/rocketGame/blob/main/RoketGame/GameScene/Extensions_GameScene.swift#L12) - saving development time by implementing less SKSpriteNode in .sks files for each level
- Save Rocket last position to UserDefaults and on game launch/resume - rocket starts from saved position
